A warlock who used to be with the party and was killed by some petty criminals

Backstory:
Garret Umbrose was a bandit and a street tough. He took what he needed from those who selfishly tried to use there luck in having too much to get more. Traders are always selfish creatures asking for more than they need. He fell in love with a woman called [[Eisheth]]. And they spent several months together before deciding to be wed. There was just 1 problem. Her father. [[Graz’zt]] Demon Lord of Azzagrat. He didn’t think it appropriate for his daughter to be involved with a lowly street thug. But [[Graz’zt]] treasured the happiness of his daughter so decided to hire Garret. Bestowing upon him the title of Emissary of the [[Argent Palace]] this title came with abilities granted by the Demon Lord and a new name. Zevuv. Zevuv now travels the material plane for [[Graz’zt]]. He will often return to give reports and see his wife, but sometimes when [[Graz’zt]] feels generous he will send [[Eisheth]] to collect the report directly to allow the 2 younglings the chance to be alone together.
