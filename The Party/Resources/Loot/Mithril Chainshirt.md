*Armour (chain shirt), uncommon*

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity ([Stealth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/using-ability-scores#Stealth)) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.
