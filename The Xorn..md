The xorn escaped from [[Riley's Operation]] while [[The Party]] attacked them.
it has since been terrorising [[Kadahn]]

- The[[Twilight Pegasus Guild]] want the creature dealt with as quickly as possible, so have asked the party to kill it.
- [[Duke]] wants the creature captured and stored in a *discrete* location for his Organisation to pick up. He will pay us 100 gold, and allow [[Bishop]] to kill [[Scarface]] in return.
- The [[Sabretooth's Guild]] want us to capture the xorn and bring it to them in exchange for reputation for [[Nem]] and [[Pyra]] and information on dragons. They wish to study it.
