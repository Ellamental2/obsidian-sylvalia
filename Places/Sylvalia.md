>"Greetings adventurers, welcome to the land of Sylvalia. You have travelled far and wide, braving treacherous seas and enduring the perils of the unknown, all to reach this magnificent land. Sylvalia is a place of wonder and mystery, where magic and adventure await those brave enough to seek it out. As you step off the boat and onto the docks, you feel a sense of excitement and anticipation, for you know that you are about to embark on a journey unlike any other. Sylvalia is a place of diverse cultures, inhabited by many different creatures and races, each with their own unique history and traditions. Here, you will find towering cities, hidden forests, ancient ruins, and treacherous dungeons, all waiting to be explored and conquered. So gather your courage and prepare for adventure, for the road ahead will be long and challenging. But with determination, skill, and luck, you may yet find fame, fortune, and glory in the land of Sylvalia.

>You will be starting out in the famous Port of [[Kadahn]], locally known as ‘The Heart’s Anchor’. We will begin by you as a party disembarking HMS Pioneer, the luxurious ship you have all been sailing on for the last month. During this time the five of you were brought together by fate, discovering a shared passion for adventure and a common goal of joining the legendary Adventuring Guilds that drive the thriving of Sylvalia!"
