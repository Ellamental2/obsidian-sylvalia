#CurrentQuest

The Xorn escaped from [[Riley's Operation]] while [[The Party]] attacked them.
it has since been terrorising [[Kadahn]]

- The[[Twilight Pegasus Guild]] and [[Horbit Hasbin]] want the creature dealt with as quickly as possible, so have asked the party to kill it.
- [[Duke]] wants the creature captured and head to the north east gate of [[Kadahn]]. He will pay us 100 gold, and allow [[Bishop]] to kill [[Scarface]] in return.
- The [[Sabretooth's Guild]] want us to capture The Xorn and bring it to them in exchange for reputation for [[Nem]] and [[Pyra]] and information on dragons. They wish to study it.

When we arrived in Kadahn, the [[Kadahn Crusaders]] appeared apparently wanting to kill The Xorn. during the fight the Crusaders were hit by a fireball aimed at The Xorn, and ran away. We accidentally knocked out the Xorn and it sank into the ground.

During the break in the fighting [[Pyra]] stole some leather scraps, and Bishop broke into town hall and stole a key to the records room, and a [[Dosier on the Twilight Pegasus Guild]]

We noticed that the Xorn was popping up and down in the same place keeping an eye on us. So we moved the cage to that spot and captured us.
we headed north east thinking that would be the fastest way back
